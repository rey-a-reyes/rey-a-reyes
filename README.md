# About me

I am a positive-thinking person who possesses two sides of power. On one hand, I am organised, structured and attentive to detail due to my background as a Technical Support Representative and IT. And on the other, due to my personality, I love to communicate with people and solve problems.

I studied for 4 years and received my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology Degree from [STI College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STI_College). I worked as a Technical Support Representative at [Radiant Global HD Inc](https://ph.indeed.com/cmp/Radiant-Global-Hd-Inc.-1/about) for 5 years,  which involved testing and fixing deffective softwares and hardwares for our clients.

Now, I wish to exploit my research and analytical skills in software testing. Currently, I am intensively studying techniques and tools by attending online courses and testing web applications created for learning purposes.

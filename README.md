# About me

I am a positive-thinking person who possesses two sides of power. On one hand, I am organised, structured and attentive to detail due to my background as a Technical Support Representative. And on the other, due to my personality, I love to communicate with people and solve problems.

I got my Bachelor's Degree from [STI College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STI_College)
